# Customer & Invoice Data â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## About
Built a multi-page Power BI dashboard linking Customer Master and Invoice Data via a 1-to-many relationship on Customer ID. Applied DAX (MTD, QTD, YTD, YoY), synced slicers and filters for segmentation and time intelligence, and created bar, map, card, and Top-N visuals. Exported to Excel for further pivot and chart analysis.

## Project Overview
This project consolidates customer and invoice data to provide actionable insights into sales trends, top customers, and geographic distribution. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into a **dynamic, interactive dashboard** to support business decisions.

- **Data cleaning & transformation** in Power Query (removing duplicates, formatting, parsing)  
- **DAX calculations** for MTD, QTD, YTD, and YoY metrics  
- **Visualizations**: bar charts, maps, cards, Top-N charts  
- **Interactive dashboards**: synced slicers, filters, multi-page layouts  
- **Excel export**: for pivot tables and additional analysis  

## Data Preparation
- Created relationships between `Customer Master.csv` and `Invoice Data.xls`  
- Cleaned and transformed invoice and customer fields in Power Query
